# Daily

## Prerequisite

- Xcode 13.1+
- Swift 5+
- CocoaPods 1.10.1+

## Installation

```
pod install
```

## Development

Open daily project by opening `Daily.xcworkspace` file instead of `Daily.xcodeproj`, or your code will not compile.

```
open Daily.xcworkspace
```

## Running SwiftLint

We have integrated [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) with Xcode already and it will be automatically run before finishing the build. 

If you need to check the code with linter, you just need to build the app by clicking on **Product > Build** or **Cmd + B**
